Linear equations solver
=============================

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination for Gauss-Jordan's
algorithm and its uses for solving systems of linear equations.

Compiling
---------

Use the ``make`` command to compile the program. The default compiler is GCC.

.. code-block:: shell

	$ make
	$ ./lineqsolve

Input format
---------------

In the file ``matrix.txt`` are entered the integers coefficients of the matrixes
separated by a single space (and none at the end of the lines). On each line are
the coefficients and the constant (result), creating in the end one more column
than there are lines.

The following system of equations

.. math::

	 x + 2y &= 3\\
	4x + 5y &= 6

would be represented in the text file as::

	1 2 3
	4 5 6
