Linear equations solver
=============================

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination for Gauss-Jordan's algorithm and its uses for solving systems of linear equations.

Step-by-step method of operations
---------------------------------

1. Read the data
2. Analyse and allocate the coefficients
3. Apply the reduction method
4. Display the results (with pretty-print?)

Input format
---------------

In the file ``matrix.txt``, integers coefficiants fo the matrixes separated by a single space (and none at the end the the lines). On each line are the coefficients and the constant, creating at the end one more column than there are lines.
